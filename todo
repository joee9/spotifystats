- implement a "temporary" file, where the songs that are still within the 50 recently played songs are kept. Then, when getting new songs, compare to the database of "previously" cataloged songs, and add the ones that have left the 50 song buffer. Then calculate and update a dictionary, called `yyyy-mm-counts.txt`, that contains the current dictiionary counts for that month. Therefore, when getting counts, you only have to analyze the 50 most recently played songs and combine them with the stored counts and resort. This will be faster. Also, allows for counts to be combined for the year and sorted as opposed to just recalculated each day.
